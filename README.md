# FYI Newsletter and blog

This site is the blog and newsletter of [Reinier Ladan](https://reinierladan.nl). For now it's all in Dutch, but who knows how long the AI overlords will take to figure out a world language that anybody can understand by way of forced augmentation.

## Run this site with Codespaces

The repository supports Codespaces, so editting and testing this site is as easy as tapping the green 'Code' button, select the 'Codespaces' tab and hit the 'Create Codespace on main' button. An online code editor and server is being deployed for you to hack away.
